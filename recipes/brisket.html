    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Brisket is the holy grail of BBQ, and learning
      <strong>how to smoke a brisket</strong> like a pro is a huge notch in your
      pitmaster belt. While there are many ways to flavor a brisket, cooking it
      properly does not leave quite as much room for experimentation or error.
      Brisket is a muscular, tough cut of meat, so low and slow is the way to go
      when learning how to cook a brisket. When prepared correctly on a Traeger,
      a smoked brisket is tender, juicy, and irresistible.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>
      <li>Traeger Beef Rub</li>
      <li>Traeger Chicken Rub</li>
      <li>Traeger Blackended Saskatchewan Rub</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Main</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A 4-6 lb flat cut brisket</li>
      <li>Beef Broth</li>
      <li>Traeger BBQ Sauce of choice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>01</span>
        Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the Worcestershire
        sauce and Traeger Beef, Chicken, and Blackened Saskatchewan rubs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>02</span>
        <p>Rub the sauce all over the brisket.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>03</span>
        When ready to cook, set the Traeger temperature to 180℉ and preheat with
        the lid closed for 15 minutes. For optimal flavor, use Super Smoke, if
        available.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>04</span>
        <p>
          Insert the probe into the thickest part of the brisket. Place the
          brisket directly on the grill grates. Close the lid and cook until the
          internal temperature reaches 160℉, 5-7 hours
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>05</span>
        <p>
          Remove the brisket from the grill. Increase the grill temperature to
          225℉.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>06</span>
        <p>
          Wrap the brisket tightly in a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum
          foil, keeping one end open. Pour the beef broth into the opening, then
          seal the packet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>07</span>
        <p>
          Return the brisket to the grill and re-insert the probe. Cook until
          the internal temperature reaches 204℉, another 4-5 hours.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>08</span>
        <p>
          Remove the brisket from the grill and let it rest in the foil pack for
          at least 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice against the grain. Serve with
          your favorite Traeger BBQ sauce. Enjoy!
